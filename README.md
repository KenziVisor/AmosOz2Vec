# AmosOz2Vec
The recent developments in the field of machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have contributed greatly to areas not directly related to engineering, such as history, language, medicine, agriculture, etc. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in use of statistical models such as Word2Vec and BERT, which enables the representation of words as real-value vectors. With this method of representation, it is possible to use mathematical operations and reach conclusions concerning for example the meaning of words and sentences. Such capabilities contribute to research in theoretical fields, including language and literature.

The aim of the project is to harness well-known NLP algorithms such as Word2Vec into a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) platform that solves various questions in the field of literature. Then, a prove to the product’s correctness is required and investigated.

The methods used in this project were experiments on Word2Vec hyper-parameters, draws of characters graphs of Amos Oz’s literature arts and output a summary of relationships between characters into excel files. To validate the results, the software’s outputs were compared to graphs and excel files, created by the literature department, by computing the Jaccard index of the top k pairs of characters score. This is how our research of the Word2Vec hyper-parameters was progressed.

The results were interesting. The manual outputs were more similar to the outputs of Word2Vec models than the output of counter co-occurrence models. We conclude from the results that Word2Vec can be used on literature arts and not just to work with neutral texts.
